# nm-objdump
A personal [nm](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?nm) and [objdump](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?objdump+1) implementation.

## Details

A fun little project I realized in my 2nd year at EPITECH (2010-2011) to learn more about object files.
The project was developed to compile and run on Linux (Fedora).

## Usage

Run the Makefile to compile the two executables `my_nm` and `my_objdump`:

```
$ make
```
